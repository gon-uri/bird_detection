# Bird Detection Algorithm

Machine learning algorithm to identify the presence and location of birds. 
Created by Gonzalo Uribarri at [Dynamcial Systems Lab](http://www.lsd.df.uba.ar/research/)

* **ES modules** and **tree-shaking** support.
* Add Size Limit to **Travis CI**, **Circle CI**, **GitHub Actions**
  or another CI system to know if a pull request adds a massive dependency.
* **Modular** to fit different use cases: big JS applications
  that use their own bundler or small npm libraries with many files.
* Can calculate **the time** it would take a browser
  to download and **execute** your JS. Time is a much more accurate
  and understandable metric compared to the size in bytes.
* Calculations include **all dependencies and polyfills**
  used in your JS.

With **[GitHub action]** Size Limit will post bundle size changes as a comment
in pull request discussion.


## How It Works

1. Size Limit contains a CLI tool, 3 plugins (`file`, `webpack`, `time`)
   and 3 plugin presets for popular use cases (`app`, `big-lib`, `small-lib`).
   A CLI tool finds plugins in `package.json` and loads the config.
2. If you use the `webpack` plugin, Size Limit will bundle your JS files into
   a single file. It is important to track dependencies and webpack polyfills.
   It is also useful for small libraries with many small files and without
   a bundler.
3. The `webpack` plugin creates an empty webpack project, adds your library
   and looks for the bundle size difference.
4. The `time` plugin compares the current machine performance with that of
   a low-priced Android devices to calculate the CPU throttling rate.
5. Then the `time` plugin runs headless Chrome (or desktop Chrome if itâ€™s
   available) to track the time a browser takes to compile and execute your JS.
   Note that these measurements depend on available resources and might
   be unstable. [See here](https://github.com/mbalabash/estimo/issues/5)
   for more details.


## Usage

### JS Applications

Suitable for applications that have their own bundler and send the JS bundle
directly to a client (without publishing it to npm). Think of a user-facing app
or website, like an email client, a CRM, a landing page or a blog with
interactive elements, using React/Vue/Svelte lib or vanilla JS.
